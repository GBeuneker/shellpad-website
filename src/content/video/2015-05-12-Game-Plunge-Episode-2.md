## Description

In this episode we analyze the design behind Half-Life 2.  
A few new subjects are discussed like pacing and subversive play.

We use the MDA framework as discussed before in the analysis. If you do not know what that is yet, watch episode 0 as an introduction to MDA: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcXizxRypds>
