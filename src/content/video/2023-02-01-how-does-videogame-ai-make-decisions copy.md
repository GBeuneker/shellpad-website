## Description

How does the Artificial Intelligence (AI) work in video games? In part 2 of this video we will show how we combine basic building blocks into more complex behaviour and how AI makes its decisions.

I will explain Finite State Machines (FSM), Behaviour Trees, Beliefs Desires Inentions model (BDI) and Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) which was used extensively in FEAR.
