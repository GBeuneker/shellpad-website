## Description

To gain insight into how caching works on a computer, we used a C++ framework in visual studio to simulate the caching a CPU performs. We included graphs about the amount of cache misses/hits per level of cache. Aditionally we created a heatmap to inspect the slots that are most frequently used in the caches as well as a graph showing the total cycle cost of the reads and writes to cache.

## Role

Programming: Geert Beuneker.
