## Description

In this game your gun canâ€™t kill enemies. The only thing you can do is make enemies jump, or dash forward. You need to make clever use of your abilities to pass the obstacles presented.

## Motivation

I wanted to gain some more experience in Game Maker. I wanted to know how much quicker it would be than Unity for building a simple prototype. It turned out that I prefer Unity of Game Maker since I had a lot more control in Unity and I like programming in Unity a lot better than programming in Game Maker. It was a good learning experience though and I can now find my way in the game maker interface.
