## Description

A real-time deck-building roguelike game inspired by Slay the Spire. It's supposed to become a hybrid of Slay the Spire, Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon.

## Motivation

This was an idea I've had for a long time and seemed like a really fun concept. While building it I thought it was pretty fun so I built and released an early playable version to test out on friends to see if it was worth expanding on. After some positive reactions this is definitely a game I'll work on more.
