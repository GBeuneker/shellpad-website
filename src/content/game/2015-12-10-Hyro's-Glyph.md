## Description

A game where we tried to blur the line between 2D and 3D worlds. You as a 3D character can pick up and rotate the 2D world. By switching between 2D and 3D you have to complete all the 2D platform puzzles.

## Motivation

This was made for the HKU Minor Game Design during the “Design for Space” project. The assignment was to create a game which had something to do with manipulating space or using it in a unique way.
