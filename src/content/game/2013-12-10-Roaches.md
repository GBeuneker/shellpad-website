## Description

A LAN multiplayer arena shooter game. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where only cockroaches survived. Each team has to protect their core from being attacked by the opposing team.

## Motivation

The game was created for an introduction game development project in my Game Technology Bachelor. We had to make the game in a group of 4/5 people within about 2 months.
