## Description

You are a giant scary monster destroying cities. But all you want is some hugs from the tiny humans. Unfortunately you destroy everything in your way while the humans try to kill you.

## Motivation

This was my submission for the Ludum Dare game jam with the theme “You are the monster”. The idea is that not only are you literally controlling a monster, in this situation one could argue that the humans are the monsters as well making “you” the monster.
