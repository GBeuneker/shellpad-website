## Description

I recreated the first super mario 64 stage: bob-ombs battlefield. I tried to maintain te secrets found in the level, the canons and as much functionality as the original Mario 64 level had.

## Motivation

I wanted to gain some more experience with hammer. I thought itâ€™d be fun to be able to walk around the classic landscape of Mario 64 in Team Fortress 2. I also felt like the hill in the map would be perfect for a king of the hill type of match.
