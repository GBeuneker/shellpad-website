## Description

You need to drag two objects together to make them disappear. If an object stays in the screen for too long it becomes a rock and can only be removed by using the magic crystals which drop at random in the level.

## Motivation

A game created for the Game Design Minor. The assignment was to recreate the game in Unity the teacher had created in swift. We were done pretty quickly so we added our own fun elements like some screenshake, extra screen effects, etc.
