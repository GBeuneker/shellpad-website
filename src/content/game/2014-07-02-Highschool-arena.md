## Description

My second rendition of creating my former highschool in Team Fortress 2. The map contains 12 secrets and is a lot of fun in arena type matches.

## Motivation

I created another version of my highschool previously and played that map with some friends. We had a lot of fun with it, but I wasnâ€™t quite happy with how that map looked. So I went back and basically started rebuilding the map from scratch. This new version looks a lot more like my previous highschool, contains some secrets and is pretty clean overall. I am quite pleased with how it turned out, especially since it is a lot of fun to play too!
