## Description

This is a mobile app released for Android. You have to catch and eat apples to get points while dodging the spikes. You control the hands with your thumbs.

## Motivation

This was a game I made as a gift for my girlfriend. She eats a lot of apples, so I thought it would be funny to make a game based around that.
