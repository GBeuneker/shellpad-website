## Description

In this game you donâ€™t control the character, you can only control the level. The character does all the walking/jumping while you have to make sure he makes it to the end by building the level.

## Motivation

This was the first game I created as part of my Game a Week challenge. As such the game was created in a single week. I wanted to experiment with some interesting new mechanics and quickly build a prototype using those mechanics. The idea was floating in my head for a while so this was a great way to quickly realize it and see if it was any fun.
