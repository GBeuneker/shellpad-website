## Description

You need to build and manage a network of trains. Build tracks between cities, buy the right trains perform maintenance on your trains, manage your budget and reroute your network if there is trouble.

## Motivation

This was my very first sizeable solo project. A friend of mine is really into infrastructure and train networks. I thought it would be fun to create a game centered around his interests.
