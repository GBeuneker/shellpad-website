An application for VR/AR on mobile phones which uses your phone's camera to project your hands into the game world.
<!--content-->

## Description
This application uses Computer Vision algorithms to detect your hands and is able to create a mask from your hands to be used as controllers in applications. Similar to what more expensive VR systems can do such as the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, this application aims to make it possible to use your hands in applications but for a really low price.

## Vision
We would like to offer an easy to use library for developers to use in their applications. This applicaiton will allow users to use their hands as controllers in VR/AR applications on their phones. Our vision is to create a market for users who do not have the money for expensive VR/AR systems but do want to experience what it is like to use those systems. Building on cheap solutions like the Google Cardboard we offer additional functionality to use your hands in the apps you use.
