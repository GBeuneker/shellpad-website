A program that uses ray/path tracing to produce realistic visual images.
<!--content-->

## Description
To gain more insight into how raytracing works I built a path tracer. It uses several acceleration structures such as BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy), NEE (Next Event Estimation), Importance Sampling and Russian Roulette. This is a project I like to keep working on, adding in new features or optimizations.
