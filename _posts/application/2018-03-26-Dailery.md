A web application where you can write a few sentences about your day every day. 
<!--content-->

## Description
Dailery is like a simple online diary. The idea is that you write about 2-3 sentences about your day every single day. It's fun to remember all the little things that are usually so easily forgotten every day. Dailery offers an easy way to keep track of your days and to read your entries back.

## Motivation
I wanted a simple application to use to remember all the little things that happen every day. So I made a website where you can save your stories coupled to dates.
