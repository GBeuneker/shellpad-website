A fighting game where you play a female toad fighting off harassing male toads.
<!--content-->

## Description
This game was part of a group project with the HKU. Michael Ottink was the main programmer on this project. I mainly assisted with smaller tasks and gave advise on certain topics to help out with the project. The idea of the project was to tackle issues of feminism and sexism in media. You play as a strong female toad fighting off another harassing male toad. The game was played with a giant controller and displayed on the public screens in Hilversum.

## Motivation
This product was made for Dropstuff, Archief beeld & geluid Hilversum and the township of Hilversum in collaboration with the HKU. Our goal was to make a product that was draws the public's attention and was fun, playable and understandable for everybody.
