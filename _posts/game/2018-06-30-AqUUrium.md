A program that uses evolutional neural networks to train fish to eat food and dodge obstacles.
<!--content-->

## Description
Together with Midas Schonewille I worked on an evolutionary neural network which trains fish to survive. We used the SharpNEAT library as a baseline and adjusted it to suit our needs. The fish become smarter with every generation as they try to learn how to locate their food and how to avoid the spiky obstacles.

## Motivation
This product was made for Dropstuff, Archief beeld & geluid Hilversum and the township of Hilversum in collaboration with the HKU. Our goal was to make a product that was draws the public's attention and was fun, playable and understandable for everybody.
