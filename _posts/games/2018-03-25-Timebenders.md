Two mages battling each other in an arena fighting, time bending frenzy! Developed by Oogbaard.
<!--content-->

## Description
I worked on several elements for the game including movement, networking and some design. Most notably I worked on the time rewinding mechanic of the game. The game can freely record frames and serialize them to files during runtime without any noticeable delay. The frame recording and playback also compensates for possible delays and lag in the gameplay, ensuring both users are always in sync. Additionally, serialized files can also be read by the program and played back. 

## Vision
[Oogbaard](http://guidoboogaard.com/) wanted to make a fun fighting game where mighty mages fight each other. A key element of the game is that mages have the power rewind and bend time to aid their battle.
